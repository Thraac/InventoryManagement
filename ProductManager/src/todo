TODO:

Done
    Make base program
        Displays current inventory
        Add to inventory
        Take in information and save it

    Sort data by ID

    Save information to a text file
        This is so that it can remember what was in it

Next to do
    Add remove
    Add edit 

    Catch errors and have pop ups (Need to add to each option)

Later to do
    Search option
    have the information load when program launches
        It does "load" on start up, but the ui does not update because the table is not static
            Will work on getting jTable1.updateUI(); to work on launch later

Way Later to do
    update data storage from file to DB
